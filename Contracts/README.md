# Time-Locked Crypto Vault

## Project Description

The Time-Locked Crypto Vault is a decentralized smart contract built on Ethereum that enables users to securely deposit ETH with customizable time-based locks. This project serves as a digital savings account where users can enforce their own financial discipline by locking away funds for predetermined periods, preventing impulsive spending and encouraging long-term wealth accumulation.

The contract operates as a trustless vault system where users maintain full control over their funds while benefiting from enforced time constraints. Each user can create multiple vaults with different lock durations and amounts, providing flexibility for various savings goals and strategies.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize personal financial management through blockchain technology by providing a secure, transparent, and user-controlled savings mechanism. We aim to:

- **Promote Financial Discipline**: Help users develop better saving habits by removing the temptation of immediate access to funds
- **Enable Goal-Based Savings**: Allow users to create specific time-locked vaults for different financial objectives
- **Provide Transparency**: Ensure complete visibility of all transactions and vault states through blockchain immutability
- **Maintain User Sovereignty**: Keep users in full control of their funds without relying on traditional financial institutions
- **Foster Long-term Wealth Building**: Encourage strategic saving and investment planning through time-based constraints

## Key Features
